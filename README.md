### Hi, I'm Daniel Maciel 👋

I'm a **Software Developer and SaaS Founder** based in Fort Worth, Texas, with over a decade of experience turning complex ideas into intuitive, high-performance software.

My passion is the entire product lifecycle, from initial architecture to final deployment. I specialize in building scalable web applications with a focus on clean code and exceptional user experience. While many of my largest projects, including my SaaS platform **[We Are Velier](https://wearevelier.com)**, are in private repositories, my work is defined by a commitment to quality and solving real-world problems.
